Since the domain is devoid of metric information (e.g. a unit sphere), metric coefficients are factored into the model representation, which is thus not directly interpretable in terms of observable quantities (e.g. wind). It may consist of several arrays, consisting of spherical harmonic coefficients, a discrete exterior calculus representation...\n\nObservable quantities may be computed using model.diagnostics()\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
